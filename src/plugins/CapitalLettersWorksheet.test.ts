// Unit tests for the CAPITAL LETTERS worksheet plugin (T4B rework).
//
// Strategy: the plugin's generator is DETERMINISTIC, so the ENTIRE sheet (all
// prompts + answers) is pinned to exact expected values produced from the real
// generator with the same seed the framework uses
// (seedFrom([grade.id, spec.id, 0])). If the algorithm, banks, or caps change,
// these exact assertions fail — which is what we want, so a silent change to
// the worksheet can't slip through.
//
// T4B additions: the "which word needs a capital letter?" rows now print the
// sentence start CORRECTLY capitalised, so exactly ONE word (the name) needs a
// capital — the old all-lower-case lines were ambiguous (start AND name).
// Two new formats join: proper-noun MCQ and full rewrite-with-capitals.
// Exact per-format counts and the 100-page capacity are pinned below.

// Unit tests for the CRAFTING SENTENCES worksheet plugin (T5 new family).
//
// Strategy: deterministic exact pins for Year 3 and Year 6 (page 1 + page 2
// head), then generator invariants over the whole stream: every MC answer is
// one of its printed options, open-ended answers carry acceptance notes, the
// 6-page window is fully unique, and the Y3/Y5/Y6 banks are DISJOINT prompt
// sets (genuine sentence-craft progression, Y5 ≠ Y6). The per-year pool is
// ~44-46 printed questions (measured, pinned below): roomy for a class set of
// six-page booklets, deliberately NOT in the 100-page unique-sampling suite.

// Unit tests for the PUNCTUATION worksheet plugin (T4B rework).
//
// Strategy: the plugin's generator is DETERMINISTIC, so the ENTIRE sheet (all
// prompts + answers) is pinned to exact expected values produced from the real
// generator with the same seed the framework uses
// (seedFrom([grade.id, spec.id, 0])). If the algorithm, pools, or caps change,
// these exact assertions fail — which is what we want, so a silent change to
// the worksheet can't slip through.
//
// T4B additions: perPage 24 -> 8; slot banks expanded (statements 28x30,
// questions 14x26, exclamations 50); two new formats join the written mark
// and mark-choice: full REWRITE (start capital + end mark) and sentence-kind
// MCQ. Capacity: the 100-page ask (800 questions) is fully unique — the old
// space was 1 076 at a 2 400-question ask.

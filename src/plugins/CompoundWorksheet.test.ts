// (all prompts + answers) is pinned to exact expected values produced from the
// real generator with the same seed the framework uses
// (seedFrom([grade.id, spec.id, 0])). Pins cover page 1 only; generator
// invariants (MC answer in options, no answer printed in compose prompts,
// open-ended answers marked, 100-page capacity) cover the whole stream.

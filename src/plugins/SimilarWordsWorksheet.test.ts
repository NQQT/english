// Unit tests for the SIMILAR WORDS (synonyms) worksheet plugin (T4B rework).
//
// Strategy: the plugin's generator is DETERMINISTIC, so the ENTIRE sheet (all
// prompts + answers) is pinned to exact expected values produced from the real
// generator with the same seed the framework uses
// (seedFrom([grade.id, spec.id, 0])). If the algorithm, tuple bank, or caps
// change, these exact assertions fail — which is what we want, so a silent
// change to the worksheet can't slip through.
//
// T4B additions: exact per-format counts (synonym MCQ, odd-one-out,
// same-meaning yes/no, context cloze) and the exact unique-question capacity
// at the 100-page ask.

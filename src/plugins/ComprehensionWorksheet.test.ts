// Unit tests for the READING COMPREHENSION worksheet plugin (T5 new family).
//
// Strategy: the generator is DETERMINISTIC, so the exact page-1 sheet and the
// page-2 head are pinned for Year 3 and Year 6 (seedFrom([grade, 'comprehension',
// 0])). The bank is FINITE BY DESIGN — 6 original passages per year, one
// passage per A4 page (perPage 1): a 100-page document re-deals whole
// passages, which is the reading-task analogue of tracing sheets (a fresh
// passage each time, never the same passage stacked above every question).
// Invariants cover the whole 100-page stream: three scaffolded questions per
// passage (literal → infer → evidence), marking-guidance answers, and the
// Y3/Y5/Y6 banks being DISJOINT sets (genuine year progression, Y5 ≠ Y6).

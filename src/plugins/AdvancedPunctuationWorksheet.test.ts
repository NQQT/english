// Unit tests for the DIALOGUE PUNCTUATION worksheet plugin (Year 5+,
// distribution quality pass).
//
// Strategy — deterministic generator: the ENTIRE page-1 sheet is pinned to
// exact expected values from the real generator with the framework seed
// (seedFrom([grade.id, spec.id, 0])). On top of the pins this suite
// INDEPENDENTLY verifies over a 20-page sample:
//   - CORRECTNESS: every answer matches one of the VALID punctuation
//     patterns for this level (quote + ?/! inside and no comma; quote +
//     comma inside; new speaker on a new line; split quote keeps the comma
//     on both sides of the reporter), has balanced quotation marks, and
//     appears among the printed options for MC rows;
//   - CONTEXT VARIETY: the old sheet printed the SAME second speaker line
//     ("Where is the map?" asked Sam.) for every layout question — the tests
//     now require many distinct two-speaker pairs;
//   - TASK VARIETY: all five prompt families occur, none dominates;
//   - DENSITY: perPage 6 (was 16), single column — writing room;
//   - SEMANTIC DIVERSITY: option-order-sorted uniqueness pinned exactly
//     (525 semantic questions at the 600-row ask; 100 pages repeat-free).
// Before/after (measured at a 3000-row ask): OLD raw pool 720 / semantic
// 150; NEW raw pool 3000 / semantic 1758 (bigger line banks, varied
// reporter pairs, new split-quote + compose families).
